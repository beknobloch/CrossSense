# CrossSense
CrossSense is our major project product for Engineering Design and Development.

The purpose of CrossSense is to make it easier for visually impaired people to safely cross streets with motor traffic. The product consists of a physical device containing sensors, which is designed to be installed on utility poles by municipalities, and a companion app intended for use by individuals with visual impairments.
